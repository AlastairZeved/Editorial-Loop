# Schema: Chain Repair

## Recognition Trigger
A reasoning chain where the reader is told a conclusion or connection rather than walked through the steps that produce it. The author asserts; the reader must trust rather than follow.

## Execution Sequence

**MAP THE CHAIN:** Number each claim, concept, or logical step in the passage in the order it appears. Write them out as a numbered list. This is the chain as presented.

**WALK THE CHAIN AS A READER:** Starting from step 1, ask at each transition:
- Does step N give me everything I need to understand step N+1?
- Or does step N+1 require me to already know something that hasn't been stated?
- Is step N+1 a conclusion that was asserted, or a conclusion I can reach from step N?

Mark every transition where the answer is "I need something that hasn't been stated" or "this was asserted, not derived." These are chain breaks.

**Exception:** Experiential grounding inserted by Barrier Bridge (e.g., "here is what was confusing about this") is not subject to derivation requirements. Bridges ground through experience; chains derive through logic. Do not flag bridges as asserted claims.

**REPAIR EACH BREAK:**
1. Identify the missing intermediate step(s)
2. Write them into the chain in the position where they naturally belong
3. Check: does inserting the step(s) break the flow of the steps before it? Read upward.
4. Check: does inserting the step(s) break the flow of the steps after it? Read downward.
5. If inserting broke either direction → rewrite the surrounding steps, not just the insertion.

**RE-MAP:** Number the repaired chain. Walk it again from step 1. Are there new breaks? If yes → repair again. If no → move to VERIFY.

**VERIFY:** Read the repaired passage as continuous prose (not as a numbered list). Does it read as a natural progression, or does it read like a list of steps? If it reads like steps → rewrite for prose flow while preserving the logical progression.

## Scale
- **Sentence level:** Not primary — individual sentences rarely contain full chains. Skip unless a single sentence packs multiple claims.
- **Paragraph level:** Primary scale. Most reasoning chains live within or across 2-3 paragraphs.
- **Section level:** Check that section-level argument arcs follow the same derivation rules (each section's conclusion reachable from its premises)
- **Document level:** Check that the document-level thesis is derivable from the section-level conclusions in the order presented (SCOPE: logical derivation chains only — document-level coherence, flow, and rhythm are Ripple Read's authority)

## Completion Test
A reader can follow the reasoning from beginning to end, in the order presented, deriving each step from the previous one. No step requires prior knowledge that hasn't been established by an earlier step.

## Measurable Features
- Count of asserted connections (told, not shown): target 0
- Count of transitions requiring unstated knowledge: target 0
- Chain walkable from step 1 to conclusion without external knowledge: yes/no
- Repaired chain reads as prose, not enumeration (indicator: no 3+ consecutive sentences with identical syntactic structure): yes/no
